FONTLOG for Nerko
-------------------
This file provides detailed information on the Nerko font.
This information should be distributed along with the Nerko font
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------

Nerko is a chunky ‘marker’ effect font. Gives a funky, exciting and modern look while staying smooth and sleek. 

Design Process: Originally drawn on an Android phone with Autodesk’s mobile sketching app. The glyphs were imported into Adobe Illustrator and vectorised. From there they were imported into FontForge for refining and spacing as a typeface. The development process was made using an OTF at all stages, so the OTF is the preferred form of modification.
